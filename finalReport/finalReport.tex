\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Main Objective}
The robot mower is an already existing project developed by previous masters students from the University of East Anglia. However, it still has areas that can be improved. One of these areas is the way the Robot covers an area in the real world in order to complete its task.
More specifically, the map generation and path planning. These aspects have been the key focuses of my project, I have broken these down into 3 key goals:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Basic map generation
	\item complete coverage path planning
	\item map generation from an aerial image
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sub Objectives}


\subsubsection{Basic Map Generation}



\section{Background}

Another section that is essential and should keep its title as is! Although you could perhaps call it ``Literature Review'' instead, this is not advisable as at this stage of your project we do not expect an extensive literature review since this was already done in the second formative assignment. The rationale is simply because you will lose valuable pages that could be used better in the next two sections that will cover the preparation and implementation of actual work done. So just provide the context in which your project operates here, and then provide a brief overview of similar work that is directly relevant to yours. Try to avoid blatant copying and pasting from the formative literature review as it is bound to read awkwardly.

\section{Methodology}

This is my preferred title for the section that follows the background but it may not work for all types of projects, in particular if your methodology is more related to planning and/or design. Either way, this section falls in the scope of \textbf{preparing your project} for action and where you list all the \textbf{methods, algorithms, tools, plans and designs} that you will need later on, as discussed in the next section. As also outlined in the project portfolio brief, one or more of the following is what would be covered in this section:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Methodology: } Explanation (and justification) of methods, algorithms (typically written in pseudo-code), mathematical or statistical models, technologies etc.\ that you will implement as part of your project. These may come from other sources (e.g.\ the literature, Github, etc.) or be your own creation. Note that it should not cover methods that you will not use! If these are worthwhile mentioning then briefly discuss them in the Background section instead.
	\item \textbf{Design: } Design of experiments, design of a survey or design of a system that consists of multiple components e.g. software (use preliminary diagrams to describe the design) or a physical manifestation such as an embedded system, a robot, etc.
	\item \textbf{Plan(ning): } Gathering of data, description of experiments (experimental plan), testing and evaluation planning. Experiments could be in the fields of data science, machine learning, signal processing, graphics, etc. Evaluation metrics could include performance speed, accuracy, relevance, etc. Although evaluation is part of the next section, evaluation \textbf{metrics} should be explained here.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation and Evaluation}

Could be a section each for implementation and evaluation if this suits you better or you could use subsections instead. The difference between this section and the previous "Methodology" section is that this one covers "action" or in other words your active contributions to the project. These may include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Implementation of programming code: Describe your final code architecture using for example (UML) diagrams and code snippets. Make sure that code snippet (figure) captions are self-explanatory which means that you should not have to consult the text body to understand what is shown in the figure. Many code snippets of the same kind should end up in an appendix instead.
	\item Results from experiments run, including testing (user and software). Use figures and tables with self-explanatory captions (see earlier statement). Multiple figures and tables that cover several pages should be put in an appendix.
	\item Analysis of results: Discuss your experimental and/or test findings in depth. Compare them against other studies and/or benchmarks, and point out limitations of your work (that could be due to limited time) and elaborate on scope for improvement.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

Another essential section that should keep its title as suggested. Briefly discuss your main findings, outcomes, results; what worked and what could have been done differently. Then summarise your work in a concluding statement by comparing your outcomes against the main and sub-objectives and/or MoSCoW requirements (if used) and suggest potential future work that could be done if more time would be available.

\section{Producing tables, figures, etc.} \label{sec2}
Please refer to the original template for different ways of formatting tables \cite{PCTut5}, figures, code snippets and pseudo code for algorithms. Make sure the caption of each of these is self-explanatory which means that you should be able to understand the figure, what's in the table, what the code is about, etc. without having to consult the text where they are referenced from.
